# Challenge for SHARENERGY 2023/01 selective process

This is a project created using NodeJs, Express, Mongoose, Express-jwt, Jsonwebtoken, Cors, Dotenv and mongoDB in the Backend and ReactJs, React-dom, React-router-dom, Axios and TailwindCSS in the Frontend.

It consists of an application that once you are logged in it consumes external APIs and an internal API.

### How to begin:

1. First, clone this repository;
2. Run `npm install` at the terminal in the root of the project;
3. Create a `.env` file based on the example `.exemple.env` presented in the backend directory;
4. Run `npm start` for the frontend and `npm run dev` for the backend;
5. Check your browser;
6. The application will run;

## You can:

- Login;
- Search for random users by their names, email or username and sort the results by name or age;
- Choose a http status code and receive a cat image of it;
- Get a random dog image, gif or video after clicking on the button;
- Manage a CRUD of clients (Create, Read, Update and Delete on data base);
- Logout;

It was a challenge that made me improve skills.
